## Welcome to My GitHub! 

### About Me

Hi! I'm **Anousha Malik**, an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at Namal University.

### What I Do

I’m passionate about Machine Learning and IC design verification projects. My current work involves understanding Embedded C Programming and delving into RISC-V to understand its ISA and its GCC toolchain. I'm also interested in integrating Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into these projects to incorporate the latest technologies.

I have hands-on experience with embedded systems and microcontrollers like AVR32. I aim to explore Silicon Valley's innovations in chip technology and dive deeper into the world of robotics and automation. I also look forward to contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with fellow engineers and developers.

### My Work

My current repositories showcase a range of projects, from beginner to advanced, that I've undertaken individually and in groups at my university. Recently, I’ve worked with GNU Radio, an open-source software, to learn about how it reflects the modulation system of transmission and reception. Additionally, I’ve gained experience with Cisco networking, which has deepened my understanding of communication networks. Earlier in my academic journey, I completed various programming projects, from mini to major, using languages such as C++, C, Python, and Verilog.
