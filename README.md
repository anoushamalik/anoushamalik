### About Me

Hi! I'm **Anousha Malik**, an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at Namal University.

### What I Do

Iâ€™m passionate about Machine Learning and IC design verification projects. My current work involves understanding Embedded C Programming and delving into RISC-V to understand its ISA and its GCC toolchain. I'm also interested in integrating Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into these projects to incorporate the latest technologies.

I have hands-on experience with embedded systems and microcontrollers like AVR32. I aim to explore Silicon Valley's innovations in chip technology and dive deeper into the world of robotics and automation. I'm also looking forward to contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with fellow engineers and developers.

### My Work

My current repositories showcase a range of projects, from beginner to advanced, that I've undertaken individually and in groups at my university. Recently, Iâ€™ve worked with GNU Radio, an open-source software, to learn about how it reflects the modulation system of transmission and reception. Additionally, Iâ€™ve gained experience with Cisco networking, which has deepened my understanding of communication networks. Earlier in my academic journey, I completed various programming projects, from mini to major, using languages such as C++, C, Python, and Verilog.
